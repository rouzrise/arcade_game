## How to play

### 1. Your principal aim is to get more than 35 scores.
To win the game you (**Player**) should get **35** scores (or more).

When you start the game you already have **20** scores.
Every time you hit a **Bug**, you lose **2** scores.
Every time you collect a **Gem**, you get **1** score. 
Every time a **Bug** collects a **Gem** - your score decreases at **1** point.
When you reach (and touch) **Water** - your scores increase at **3** points.

## 2. _Briefly:_ Things that increase scores.

Collecting **Gem** - plus **1** score.
Touching **Water** - plus **3** scores.

_Note!!!!_ Every time you touch **Water** - you'll be automatically transferred to some random place on grass.

### 3. _Briefly:_ Things that decrease scores.

Hitting **Bug** - minus **2** scores.
**Bug** eating **Gem** - minus **1** score.

_Note!!!!_ Every time you touch a **Bug** - you'll be automatically transferred to some random place on grass.

### 4. Room for movement.

**Player** can move anywhere within Canvas.
**Bugs** can only move at the stone pavement.
While you are at the grass - you are safe and **Bugs** can't touch you. But don't just stand and look around - **Bugs** can also collect **Gems** and turn it into Game Over. 

### 5. GAME OVER.

When you start the game you already have **20** scores. As **Bugs** eat **Gems** and you hit **Bugs** - your score decreases. 
As soon as your score gets to **0** - you lose. 

Don't worry! - you may always press "Play again" button and take your revenge;)

### 6. Restart.
You can restart game at any time - just press 'Play again' button - and 'The show will begin from the start!')

### 7. Compete!
Show who wins - you or Bugs?!
